🧪 Beginner Practice Prompt: Simple Counter App
📝 Description:

Create a React component called <Counter /> that:

Displays a number starting at 0
Has a “+” button to increase the count
Has a “-” button to decrease the count
Has a “Reset” button that sets the count back to 0

🧠 Goals:
Practice using useState
Handle button click events
Update and display state in the UI

Don’t allow the count to go below 0
Add a message when the count reaches 10: “Nice! You reached 10!”
Use useEffect to log to the console every time the count changes
